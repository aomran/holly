# Word Problem App

This Rails app was originally created by Ahmed, Paula and Mike (at HackerYou's Summer Academy).

The logic in the model was later extended by me (Ahmed) and I added some javascript to make it a "one-page" app.

As per Paula's suggestion, I enabled chrome web speech input. So the app now takes in voice input.
